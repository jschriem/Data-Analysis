In late 2018, something remarkable occurred in the global art market. The first AI collaboration artwork sold in an auction for 432,500 [1] setting off waves of discussion and speculation about the future of AI-generated art. The auctioned art piece was created using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) AI, which has become the latest widespread trend in machine learning-based artwork [2]. GANs are particularly adept at producing visual indeterminate artworks [2] which have historically brought about much debate about the characteristics of creativity [3]. As AI continues to improve, will human creativity need to compete with these infinite novel creations generated by neural networks? We may still be far from this reality, but this project plans to explore exactly how GANs operate and will test if our own art-generating AI can fool an art classifying neural network.
